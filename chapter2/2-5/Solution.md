# Assumptions made
- Two different addresses could not have the same phone number
- Two instruments with the same name but different musical keys are considered as two different instruments
- Two songs can have the same title as long as it is authored by two different people
- The author of a song is not necessarily a musician
- A song must be performed by at least one musician
- An album must have a song
